# TODO

- [x] Add a Random mode, so a user doesn't have to select a specific category or topic. (Already implemented with "Surprise me" button)
- [x] Add a selector of Curated / Non Curated questions to the Topic selection screen, so users can choose to play only curated questions if they want. When Curated is selected, only topics with curated questions should be shown.
- [x] Add a count of curated questions next to each topic in the Topic selection screen.
- [x] Move curated questions to their own file for easier management and add a button to reload curated questions without needing to redeploy the app.
