### Code Quality

```bash
# Run linter
yarn lint

# Auto-fix linting issues
yarn lint:fix

# Format code
yarn format
```

### Adding Content

#### New Topics

Edit `public/data/topics.json` and add to the array:

```json
{
  "id": "your-topic-id",
  "name": "Display Name",
  "category": "Category Name",
  "tags": ["tag1", "tag2", "tag3", "tag4"]
}
```

#### Curated Questions

Edit individual topic files in `public/data/curated/[topic-id].json`:

```json
{
  "easy": [
    { "q": "Your question?", "a": "The answer", "angle": "quote" }
  ],
  "medium": [...],
  "hard": [...]
}
```

After adding a new topic file, update the index:

```bash
yarn update-index
```

Users can reload curated questions in the app without redeploying using the "↻ Reload" button.

#### Answer Examples

Add real-world examples to `public/data/answer-examples.json`:

```json
{
  "your-topic-id": {
    "character name": [
      "Luke Skywalker",
      "Princess Leia",
      "Han Solo"
    ]
  }
}
```

These examples are used when generating template-based questions to provide factual content.

## 🏗️ Built With

- **TypeScript 5.9.3** - Type-safe development with strict mode
- **Vite 7.2.4** - Fast build tool and dev server
- **Preact Signals 1.12.1** - Fine-grained reactive state management
- **vite-plugin-pwa 1.2.0** - Progressive Web App with Workbox service worker
- **Biome 2.3.8** - Fast linting and formatting
- **localStorage** - Progress persistence with automatic signal-based updates

## 📝 Architecture Highlights

- **Reactive State Management**: Preact Signals for automatic UI updates and persistence
- **Modular TypeScript**: Organized into state, UI, data, and utility modules with strict types
- **Modular Data Loading**: Individual 4-12 KB topic files loaded in parallel
- **Lazy Loading**: Questions generated only when needed
- **Smart Caching**: Avoids regenerating questions for same topic/difficulty/mode
- **Deterministic Shuffle**: Consistent question order across sessions using LCG algorithm
- **PWA Architecture**: Auto-generated service worker with Workbox for offline support
- **XSS Protection**: All user-facing content HTML-escaped
- **Error Recovery**: Graceful fallbacks for missing data or localStorage failures
- **Debounced Operations**: Search and mode changes optimized to prevent excessive calculations

## 🎯 Design Philosophy

1. **Type Safety First**: TypeScript ensures reliability and maintainability
2. **Curated Quality**: Prioritize hand-written factual questions over generated ones
3. **No Backend**: Everything runs client-side for simplicity and privacy
4. **Offline-Ready**: PWA with service worker works in areas with poor/no connectivity
5. **Reactive by Default**: Preact Signals provide automatic UI updates without manual DOM manipulation
6. **Progressive Enhancement**: Generated questions fill gaps in curated content
7. **Real Examples**: Use actual answers (movie scenes, song titles, historical events) instead of placeholders

## 📱 Browser Support

- **Modern Browsers**: Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Edge (ES2020+ support required)
- **PWA Support**: Installable on mobile and desktop devices
- **Offline Capability**: Service workers cache content for use without internet
- **Storage**: Uses localStorage for saving progress

## 🤝 Contributing
